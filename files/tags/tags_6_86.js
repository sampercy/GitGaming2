On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 radiant damage, and it is blinded for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't blinded. At the end of each of its turns, a blinded creature can make a Constitution saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77654","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"2","tagname":"Class","tagvalue":"Cleric","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77655","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"4","tagname":"Class","tagvalue":"Paladin","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"general","tagkey":"39996","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"0","tagname":"#itemtype","tagvalue":"Spell","sortlevel":"99"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77659","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"0","tagname":"Damage Type","tagvalue":"Rad","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77661","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"0","tagname":"Die Count","tagvalue":"2","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77663","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"0","tagname":"Die Face","tagvalue":"8","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77658","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"1","tagname":"Damage Type","tagvalue":"Rad","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77660","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"1","tagname":"Die Count","tagvalue":"4","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"SP","tagkey":"77662","itemcode":"sp-holy-weapon","sequence":"1","tagname":"Die Face","tagvalue":"8","sortlevel":"20"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"83609","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Components Blurb","tagvalue":"a pickled octopus tentacle","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77687","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Duration Short","tagvalue":"1Min","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77688","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Duration","tagvalue":"1 minute","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77689","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Level","tagvalue":"3rd Level","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77690","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Level Number","tagvalue":"3","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77691","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Level Short","tagvalue":"3","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77692","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Name","tagvalue":"Hunger Of Hadar","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77694","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Range","tagvalue":"150'","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77695","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"School Short","tagvalue":"Conj","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77696","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"School","tagvalue":"Conjuration","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77675","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Casting Time Short","tagvalue":"A","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77676","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Casting Time","tagvalue":"1 action","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77679","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Components Short","tagvalue":"VSM","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"84638","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Source Book","tagvalue":"","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"77680","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"0","tagname":"Concentration","tagvalue":"Concentration","sortlevel":"10"},{"itemsource":"5e","tagkey":"83610","itemcode":"sp-hunger-of-hadar","sequence":"1","tagname":"Text","tagvalue":"You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown horrors.
