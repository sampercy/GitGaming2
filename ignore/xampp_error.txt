When MySQL won't start, it seems to be just a necessity to remove three files from here:

C:\xampp\mysql\data

Namely:

ib_logfile0
ib_logfile1
aria_log_control

Some other sugeestions help or do not help, but the backup folder does seem to be valid, just missing the folders for other dbs, and the file:
ibdata1

Try to remember to launch xampp as admininstrator

If not, shut down the mysql service from xampp.

UPDATE APRIL (2022)
Rename folder mysql/data to mysql/data_old
Make a copy of mysql/backup folder and name it as mysql/data
Copy all your database folders and mysql folder from mysql/data_old into mysql/data
Copy mysql/data_old/ibdata1 file into mysql/data folder
Start MySQL from XAMPP control panel

When you're not running XAMPP as an administrator, shutting down MySQL frequently causes corruption which means you have to repair or delete your tables. 
To avoid this you need to either run XAMPP as an administrator, or use the proper command prompt method for shutting down MySQL.

You can delete ibdata1 as Kratos suggests, but this can leave you with a broken database as other pieces of your database are still in the /mysql/data/ folder. 
In my case, this residual data stopped me successfully installing WordPress.

A cleaner way of undoing the damage is to revert your whole /mysql/data/ folder. 
Windows has built-in folder versioning â€” right click on /mysql/data/ and select Restore previous versions. 
You can then delete the current contents of the folder and replace it with the older version's contents.

Addendum: To ensure that you don't forget to run XAMPP as an administrator you can right click the XAMPP shortcut, 
  go to Properties, then Advanced, and finally tick Run as administrator.
